Once she had heard that Lorenshi had wanted to take a step aside to take a breather from the surprise commotion, Maeko changed into an outfit, completely covering her body and then strapped a ballistic mask to her face to make her completely anonymous. Then, she picked up a large manila folder containing files of every gang member and squeezed it between her arm and torso so she could still use both hands. Then, before exiting the room, she quickly placed her file on the floor with the rest of the loose papers in the back room and lit it ablaze, leaving no physical proof she was part of the gang and reducing all the leftover files to a pile of carbon. Finally she would quietly sneak out of the door and look to the right where she would spot Lorenshi, her head down and not paying attention to her surroundings. Lunging toward Lorenshi, Maeko would place her hand over Lorenshi&#39;s mouth and </span><span class="c10">pulled</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;a knife out from a holster and </span><span class="c10">held</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;it to her neck.
