When it came to her bangs, he placed his hand on her forehead over Shylah&#39;s eyes to prevent water from dripping down her face and into her eyes. Giggling for a moment, he reached back toward the drawers at the bathroom counter and opened a different one this time, pulling out a pair of goggles and closing the drawer again. He adjusted the rubber band&#39;s tightness according to her head size and then placed it over her eyes, the strap being placed around her head, yet slotted under her hair so as not to get in the way. </span><span>&quot;That should do it!&quot;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;After giggling once more, he continued to wet her hair completely. He then placed down the nozzle on the edge of the tub, having it shoot downward before reaching over to the bottle of shampoo and picking it up, popping open the lid and carefully squirting some out onto his hand. The blood orange scented, damage fixing, fortifying shampoo filled his hand before being placed directly onto her head where Shylah&#39;s hair was still visibly parted. He pointed his fingers down and lowered them into her hair to scrub with a slight added force to make sure the shampoo got into the small crevices of her thick curly hair. Making sure to rub, using a rotating, circular, scratching motion to the side of her head, the front where her bangs were, then especially the top where it was the most important to keep clean. He then palmed her hair between his hands as he went down her leaking locks, rubbing the air between his hands to scrub them in an efficient method. He then picked up the nozzle again and began to rinse off </span><span class="c2">her hair</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of shampoo. He parted her hair in various locations with the tip of his finger to make sure the blasting pressure of the water was able to reach the bases of each and every strand of hair. Gyrating the nozzle around her hair once more, he finished </span><span class="c2">rising</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;the shampoo from her hair. After a moment to rest, he reached down and grasped the bottle of conditioner, one that was formulated to keep her hair conditioned and knot free. He placed some onto his hand and continued to spread the conditioner across the entirety of her hair. He then used his fingers masterfully to push the conditioner into her hair and knead it between the knots before allowing it to sit for a moment. He would let it sit for a few minutes, while in the meantime drawing pictures such as clouds and a heart into her hair so that she could feel it. He played with her hair a little as it had time to soak in the conditioner. Once the sitting was over, he grabbed the shower nozzle once again and carefully rinsed her hair to remove the conditioner from within. With his other hand, he picked up a small comb he kept by, to gently comb through her hair to make sure the bigger knots were released. He reached to turn up the pressure of the water a little as he knew from experience that the conditioner was much more difficult to rinse out. Once her hair had been rinsed enough, he hung the handheld shower nozzle at its resting place before grabbing a towel that was sitting on the toilet lid, opening it up, and dropping it over her head. He reached around, carefully pulled the goggles off her face and then temporarily threw them to the corner of the bathroom. He then placed his hands on top of her head where the towel was and then aggressively rubbed her head with the towel drying up as much of the water as he could, allowing it to be left slightly damp. Then using another, significantly smaller towel, he wrapped the leaking hair into it and squeezed it to fully soak up the majority of the water. He took a step back, allowing her to turn her head toward him where he gave her two big thumbs up paired with a smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">[</span><span class="c0">College</span><span class="c1">][</span><span class="c0">M</span><span class="c1">][</span><span class="c7">Track</span><span class="c1">] </span><span>Kenzo Yamada-Wakabayashi says &ldquo;Your clothes are still pretty dirty.

He put her hands in the pajama pants pockets, smiling and flapping her hands around the inside of them. The pants sat baggy and low-waisted on her.

The downstairs radio continuing it&#39;s soft tune, &quot;Hold Me In Your Arms&quot; by Rick Astley creeped out of the radio&#39;s speakers to the beat of their ever synchronizing heartbeat, and a soft rain began to pitter patter on the roof of the building in a mesmerizing ambient sound. The heavy duvet, melted like a buttered pancake, protected them from the chill in the room and allowed their body heat to clash with one another, soothing both bodies as the night went on. A full moon crept over them as the sun awaited the next lovely day.</span></p></body></html>
