          Satsujin-kai, a gang that originated in the <u>southernmost region of Japan during 1987</u>, was known formerly for its profitable organizations and there ability to blend in like normal people. Satsujin-kai continued to strive all the way up to 2012, until one of their bloodthirsty members turned on their own kin, slaughtering most of the team and revealing the location of their home base, putting the safety of every member in grave danger. Only three members managed to remain: '<b>Ath</b>,' '<b>Chaos</b>,' and '<b>Jouka</b>.' Jouka took control of the gang as he had felt the never ending bias originating from the people in power was getting to be too much and needed to come to an end. So, he gathered like-minded people, those with dark pasts, instincts like no other and ones with bloodlust you could feel from nothing more than their glaring eyes. He built a collection of contacts allowing him to set up alliances with other gangs to make them more powerful than anyone would have expected. The group pursued with this, continuing to strive as they did before, but this time they were bigger, better and relentless to do what ever needed to get done.

          The team of shadows that lurked through the city were highly specialized in striking when you least expect it. They focused on business and transport of product to the people of Karakura. Alcohol, weapons, support. Whatever made them money, they'd do. There to set the population straight and to take back the power from the those who held it and haunt the civilians even in their best of dreams.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Now, present day. Ath and Chaos, slaughtered during a gang war in 2021. Jouka, gone. The details on his whereabouts are nonexistent. Nobody knows whether he breathes or not. Their base of operations, left dormant, caked in dust; until one day, a young lady stumbled across this hideout. Files scattered across the floor and note cards pinned to a dried up cork board. She spent the better part of a month reading all there was to read, exploring and processing what she saw. Then, she vanished herself, into the shadows. A dark figure now roams the streets at the dead of night, warning those that stroll to watch their backs.
